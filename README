#	Perl5 Libwww-perlWin32   Martin.Cleaver@BCS.org.uk    Release 2.1   22/Feb/1997
#								
#			This script may be distributed under the same 
#			terms and conditions as Perl itself.
#
#	Libwww-perl (LWP) is a library of Perl modules that facilitate 
#	easy programming of the WWW. LWP can be found at:
#		http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=LWP
#	or:	http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/
#
#	lwpWin32 is a Quick'n'Dirty Script to patch libwww-perl-5 to less 
#	up-to-date platforms.
# 	I see this being useful in two scenarios:
#		1) to use LWP in a Win32 environment
#		2) to use LWP where Perl 5.003 is not available 
#				(this use is untested)
#
#	lwpWin32 has been tested with LWP 5.05 and appears to work fine under
#	5.07. 
#
# INSTRUCTIONS AT THE TOP OF THE SCRIPT!
